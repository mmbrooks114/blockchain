# blockchain
Code that I have developed for use in my blockchain development.
Included files:
- Secp256k1.py An implementation of Elliptic Curve Multiplication using the secp256k1 curve for private key/public key cryptography (Takes n number of private Keys *inputted as HEXADECIMAL* and returns n compressed (only the x value) public keys that correspond to those private keys)
